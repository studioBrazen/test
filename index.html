      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        In 1997, psychologist Arthur Aron explored whether intimacy between two
        perfect strangers could be accelerated by asking each other a set of 36
        questions. We adapted his questions for use in a new kind of social
        experiment, aimed at helping us all fall in civic love.
      </p>

      <h2>What is civic love?</h2>
      <p>
        Civic love is one’s love for society, expressed through a commitment to
        the common good. It is a belief in the idea that we’re all better off,
        when we are all better off. We manifest it through all kinds of actions
        — volunteering, marching, speaking against systemic injustice, making
        reparations — but the love itself is the emotional heart of the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spirit of activist Grace Lee Boggs, 36 Questions for Civic Love
        is an attempt to help “bring to our communities the limitless capacity
        to love, serve, and create for and with each other.

      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>
        You and a partner will each ask each other a series of 36 questions — in
        person, or through an online platform. You should allocate 90 minutes to
        the process, though previous participants have finished in less time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take turns introducing yourself, including your name and pronouns.
        Continue to take turns, asking your partner each of the 36 questions.
        You ask a question and your partner answers; your partner then asks you
        the SAME question and you answer. Repeat using the remaining 35
        questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t jump around. Answer the questions sequentially, 1 to 36. Though
        some questions may be difficult — challenge yourself to stay in it,
        answering all of the questions to the best of your ability. This
        experiment is designed to not only help us share things about ourselves
        but also to listen, without comment, as someone shares with us. Make
        every attempt to listen with curiosity, minimizing distractions and
        interruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resist the urge to give feedback on your partner’s response or to ask
        additional questions about their answers. Allow them the space to simply
        share and be heard.

        36 Questions for Civic Love is truly a social experiment. We are 
continually improving the project to better grow civic love. We’ve developed a quick five question survey to help us. You can find it 
at <a href="nphm.org/civiclove">nphm.org/civiclove.</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Spreading the love</h2>

        As we work to spread the love, we invite you to share your experience on

      <h2>About the National Public Housing Museum</h2>
      <p>
        The National Public Housing Museum (NPHM) is the first cultural
        institution in the United States dedicated to interpreting the American
        experience in public housing and the right of all people to a place they
        can call home. The Museum’s mission is to preserve, promote, and propel
        public housing as a human right and all of our partnerships and programs
        are committed to amplifying the voices, experiences, and stories of
        public housing residents. Ultimately, we believe that storytelling can
        be a catalyst for innovative public policy solutions that are responsive
        to people’s needs and lived experiences.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        This toolkit was created by the National Public Housing Museum with the
        support of Sarah Pharaon, Principal (Dialogic Consulting), Lauren
        Meranda (Studio Brazen), and is made possible with funding from
        Allstate, the Illinois Arts Council Agency, the Kresge Foundation, and
        the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events.

        <h2>About Lauren Meranda, Principal Designer, Studio Brazen</h2>
        <p>
          Studio Brazen provided the visual identity and experiential design for
          36 Questions for Civic Love. Creative pursuits with good intentions,
          Studio Brazen is a multi-disciplinary design studio run by Lauren
          Meranda, specializing in projects for cultural institutions, social
          activism, civic engagement, and public memory through experimental
          media, collaborative storytelling, and interactive design for physical
          spaces. As a designer and producer of visual culture, Lauren strives
          to find means by which to let public memory emerge from the stories of
          the people it is bound to define. The projects and exhibits she works
          on seek to empower the individual to participate in the storytelling
          process and expand public memory to include previously unheard voices.
